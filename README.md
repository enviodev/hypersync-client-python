# hypersync-client-python
Python package for [Envio's](https://envio.dev/) HyperSync client written in Rust

### Example usage
```python
import hypersync
import asyncio

async def main():

    # Create hypersync client using the mainnet hypersync endpoint
    client = hypersync.hypersync_client(
        "https://eth.hypersync.xyz",
    )

    height = await client.get_height()
    print("Height:", height)
